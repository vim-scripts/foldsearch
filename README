This plugin provides commands that fold away lines that don't match a specific search pattern.  This pattern can be the word under the cursor, the last search pattern, a regular expression or spelling errors. There are also commands to change the context of the shown lines.

Commands:

:Fw [context*]
  show lines which contain the word under the cursor. Default [context] is 0.
 
:Fs [context*]
  show lines which contain previous search pattern. Default [context] is 0.
 
:Fp pattern
  show the lines that contain the regular expression. Context is 0.

:FS
  show the lines that contain spelling errors.
 
:Fl
  fold again with the last used pattern

:Fc [context*]
  show context lines.
 
:Fi
  increment context by one line.
 
:Fd
  decrement context by one line.
 
:Fe
  set modified fold options to their previous value

* context can consist of one or two numbers. A 'unsigned' number defines the context before and after the pattern. If a number has a '-' prefix, it defines only the context before the pattern. If it has a '+' prefix, it defines only the context after a pattern.

Mappings:

<Leader>fs     FoldSearch()
<Leader>fw     FoldCword()
<Leader>fl     FoldLast()
<Leader>fS     FoldSpell()
<Leader>fi     FoldContextAdd(+1)
<Leader>fd     FoldContextAdd(-1)
<Leader>fe     FoldSearchEnd()
